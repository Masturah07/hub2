    <p>Nigerian Breweries Plc, the pioneer and largest brewing Company in Nigeria was incorporated in 1946 as "Nigerian Brewery Limited". In June 1949, the Company recorded a landmark when the first bottle of STAR lager beer rolled out of its Lagos Brewery bottling lines. In 1957,the company commissioned its second brewery in Aba and the name became "Nigerian Breweries Limited". This was followed by Kaduna Brewery in 1963 and lbadan Brewery in 1982. Following the coming into effect of the Companies and Allied Matters Act in 1990,the name of the company was changed to "Nigerian Breweries Plc" to reflect its public limited liability status.</p>
    <p>In 1993, the Company acquired its fifth brewery in Enugu and in 2003, a sixth brewery (Ama Brewery), sited at Amaeke Ngwo in Enugu State was commissioned. Operations in the old Enugu Brewery were discontinued in 2004 following the completion of Ama Brewery. An ultramodern malting plant was acquired in Aba in 2008.</p>
    <P>In October 2011, the Company acquired majority equity interests in two companies, Sona Systems Associates Business Management Limited (“Sona Systems”), with two breweries in Ota and Kudenda, Kaduna, and Life Breweries Company Limited (“Life Breweries”) with a brewery in Onitsha. Another malting plant (located in the Kudenda, Kaduna Brewery) was acquired as part of the Sona Systems acquisition. Sona Systems and Life Breweries were merged with the Company in the middle of 2012. At the end of 2014, an enlarged Nigerian Breweries Plc emerged from a merger with Consolidated Breweries Plc. Three breweries at lmagbon, near ljebu-Ode, Awo-Omamma, near Owerri and Makurdi were added to the existing eight breweries as a result of the merger. The Onitsha and Makurdi locations were subsequently developed into Distribution Centers.</p>
    <p>Thus, from a humble beginning in 1946, the Company now has nine fully operational breweries from which its high-quality products are produced and distributed to all parts of Nigeria, in addition to the two malting plants in Aba and Kaduna. It also has Sales Offices and Distribution Centers across the country.</p>
    <p>Nigerian Breweries Plc has a rich portfolio of high quality brands: Star lager beer was launched in 1949, followed by Guider lager beer in 1970. Maltina, the nourishing malt drink, was introduced in 1976, followed by legend Extra Stout in 1992 and another malt drink, Amstel Malta in 1994. Heineken lager beer was re-launched into the Nigerian market in 1998. Fayrouz, the premium non alcoholic soft drink, was launched in 2006 while Climax herbal energy drink was launched in 2010. Following the acquisition of Sona Systems and Life Breweries in 2011, Goldberg lager, Malta Gold malt drink and life Continental lager, were added to the brand portfolio. The Company increased its portfolio of brands in 2014 with the</p> </div>
